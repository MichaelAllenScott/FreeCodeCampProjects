 
I Look Like Shit
    - Album Context
        Written after BTMI! was disbanded, I Look Like Shit unceremoniously became Jeff's solo debut. Jeff describes the reasoning for this album best: "A handful of them were demos for a 
        Bomb the Music Industry! EP called I Always Dread The End Of Summer, but shit got busy and that didn't end up happening. And then a bunch of them was for a slower record I was 
        working on called I'm Serious, I'm Sorry, but it wasn't really coming together terribly fast and who the hell knows if that'll ever happen. However, I do know that if leave a bunch of 
        food on your kitchen counter for too long, that shit is gonna get moldy, start attracting flies and smell like shit. So instead of having these jams just sit around doing nothing, 
        here they all are along with some more new songs and some covers in full noisy drum machine shitty vocals glory." I Look Like Shit helped set Jeff's solo stuff apart from his former 
        ASOB and BTMI! work as most of the songs don't really sound like either of those. It's a very personal album, with less punk, more piano, and lyrics that sound like they were ripped straight from a diary.
        These songs are depressing, like nihlistic, there is no point to anything why bother, depressing. Jeff considered not even releasing them because he thought they might be too much.
        He eventually released them because his friends reminded him that: "it's okay to release songs with lyrics that I may think are too dark and reminding me that those are actually the only lyrics I ever want to listen to"
        The album serves as a great start to Jeff's solo career, distinguishing his newer style from his older style, allowing him to make whatever music he wants without being beholden to a genre.
