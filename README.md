# FreeCodeCampProjects
All my projects created for Free Code Camp exercises

### 1. [Tribute Page](https://michaelallenscott.github.io/FreeCodeCampProjects/Build-A-Tribute-Page/Rosenstockcom.html)
  - Tribute page built around the discography of Jeff Rosenstock.

### 3. [Random Quote Machine](https://michaelallenscott.github.io/FreeCodeCampProjects/Build-A-Random-Quote-Machine/Vonnequotes.html)
  - Random Quote Machine built for Kurt Vonnegut Quotes only.
  - This is kind of cheating, because I couldn't find an api that would successfully only return Kurt Vonnegut Quotes, without massive string interpolation logic. So I just put them in a string array. Cheap, but I aready know how to do API calls and I really wanted to do Vonnegut quotes only.
