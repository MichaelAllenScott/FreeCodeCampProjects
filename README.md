# FreeCodeCamp Projects
Some of my cooler projects created for Free Code Camp exercises

### - [Tribute Page](https://michaelallenscott.github.io/Projects/FreeCodeCampProjects/Build-A-Tribute-Page/Rosenstockcom.html)
  - Tribute page built around the discography of Jeff Rosenstock.
  - Jeff Rosenstock's music is very chaotic and spastic, so I wanted this page to have a messy, notebook-scribble feel to it. I spent most of my time, first writing the album descriptions, then Illustrating the images that go along with each album. I'm really happy with the look and I learned a lot about web illustration + using custom images to really make a design pop.

### - [Random Quote Machine](https://michaelallenscott.github.io/Projects/FreeCodeCampProjects/Build-A-Random-Quote-Machine/Vonnequotes.html)
  - Random Quote Machine built for Kurt Vonnegut Quotes only.
  - This is kind of cheating, because I couldn't find an api that would successfully only return Kurt Vonnegut Quotes, without massive string interpolation logic. So I just put them in a string array. Cheap, but I aready know how to do API calls and I really wanted to do Vonnegut quotes only.
  
# College Projects
Projects done for Computer Science Major 3-5 years ago. Many of these are very outdated and no longer really relevant. But I'm proud of my progress, so I left them on here

### - [Color Picker](https://michaelallenscott.github.io/Projects/CollegeProjects/Color-Picker/337FP/337FP.html) 
  - A project that utilizes SVG to mimick the Photoshop Color Picker.
  - This project utlilizes a lot of interesting gradient tricks, that were very difficult for me at the time.
  - Created for an Introduction to Web Graphics course.

### - [USA Data Visualizer](https://michaelallenscott.github.io/Projects/CollegeProjects/USA-Data-Visualization/317FP.html) 
  - Utilizes and SVG map to plot 2 different data sets
  - One of my first attempts at Data Visualization, A field I am very interested in.
  
### - [Picture-Unscrambler](https://michaelallenscott.github.io/Projects/CollegeProjects/Picture-Unscrambler/as4.html) 
  - Created for an introduction to javascript course, this is pretty basic
  - However there is a little bonus after solving the puzzle that I enjoyed making. This was one of my first attempts at adding interesting visual illustrations to make the webpage more interesting.
