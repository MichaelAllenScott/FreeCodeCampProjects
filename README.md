### 1. Random Quote Machine - 1.0
    - Random Quote Machine built for Kurt Vonnegut Quotes only.
    - This is kind of cheating, because I couldn't find an api that 
      would successfully only return Kurt Vonnegut Quotes, without massive
      string interpolation logic. So I just put them in a string array.
