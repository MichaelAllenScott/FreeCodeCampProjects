- Album Minus Band
    - Album Context 
        Written after the breakup of Jeff's original Ska-Punk band The Arrogant Sons of Bastards. Album Minus Band is an album that just kind of happened.
        After the breakup, Jeff started experimenting with some samples from other bands and randomly started recording stuff. 
        Not wanting to forget a song lyric, he quickly recorded the song "Sweet Home Cananada" on his mac. This was the start of the band Bomb the Music Industry! 
        This continued with Jeff suddenly having an idea, then recording it with his mac and a $100 microphone. Eventually these tidbits came together to form "Album Minus Band". 
        Jeff was already known for having firm beliefs in the DIY mythos. This ideology would take full form in his new band.
        Bomb the Music Industry! would later become "famous" for being one of the true DIY experiment bands. Only playing <$10 all ages shows, burning their cd's for fans at no cost, 
        spray painting t-shirts, allowing fans who knew the songs to play onstage, and releasing all their music for free long before it became a trend. 
        This album was the start of all that. The album doesn't seem to have any connective themes, but is rather just a messy, weird, spastic, awesome journey, filled with great unlicensed quotes from tv and movies.

- To Leave Or Die In Long Island
    - Album Context
        Written almost immediately after Jeff finished Album Minus Band, To Leave or Die In Long Island is a product of being stuck with your parents in your
        twenties, working for minimum wage, and feeling like you don't really relate to what is happening around you. This didn't start as an album, but rather
        an EP. It ended up somewhere inbetween, so it's on the shorter side with only 8 tracks. Most of the songs
        are about Jeff's frustration with the daily grind and the idea of what growing up and success really mean. In general just working a crap job
        in a crap town and feeling like there is no point to it all. This is all summed up perfectly by the last song on the album
        "SYKE! LIFE IS AWESOME!" in which Jeff admits that even though he feels he's mostly wasting his time, every once in a while life gives
        you something truly nice, which sort of makes it all worth it. The last song brings the themes of sadness and existential depression together and
        leave the album on a bittersweet note. The feel of the album is similar to Album Minus Band, but a little bit more polished, and a little less 
        spastic, with each song feeling like a complete song, rather that short spurts that make a whole. The album keeps the same sound with synthesizers, saxophones,
        and drum machines assaulted at the speed of a liberated metronome.

- Goodbye Cool World
    - Album Context
        Written after Jeff moved out of his parents and into a nice apartment in an upper middle-class neighborhood in Queens, NY. With Jeff once again feeling 
        isolated, though for a different reason. Caused by living in an area of a demographic not your own, a lack of nearby friends, and no money to visit those friends. 
        The Album was almost completely recorded in Jeff's Apartment which, due to the area, meant he could only record between 5:30 and 6:30 PM. Just like AMB and TLODILI
        this album was also solely recorded on Jeff's Laptop with a cheap microphone. This album uses the same style of instruments as the first two,
        with the frenetic fake drums, synthesizers, piano, and guitars. On this album though, you can hear Jeff really start to experiment with the genres,
        not just making messy punk rock, but really injecting some pop and melody into his songs (Side Projects are Never Successful, Sorry Brooklyn Dancing Won't Solve Anything, 
        Anywhere I Lay My Head). The resulting sound is probably his weirdest album of all, with his trademark chaotic sound mixed with more traditional pop piano, horns, and synthesizers,
        creating a sort of mad-scientist, twisted fun-house album. The lyrical content is similar to the last album, with most of the songs being about isolation, depression,
        disappointment with the human race, and frustration with the music business. This is also the first album that was released for free on QuoteUnquoteRecords.com. 
        The (possibly first?) donation based record label founded by Jeff. I consider this to be the most eccentric, bizarre album Jeff has produced, so if that 
        is your thing, I'd give this one a listen.

- Get Warmer
    - Album Context
        Written during a 6 month period in Athens, Georgia. Get Warmer is the first BTMI! album that marks a transition into a more professional recording 
        process. Recorded with real people, using real instruments, in a real recording studio. Almost all the instruments were recorded live by a large group of different
        people. The band was still considered a "collective" at this point and had not boiled down to the five band members it would later become.
        The album still has the traditional BTMI! sound that the previous 3 albums had, but the real instruments give it a fuller, less 
        synthetic feel. The new production also makes the songs a bit cleaner, well formed, and more deliberate in their sound.
        It's also the first BTMI! album that has a specific theme behind it. The songs all take place in a single story arc in one location. Jeff says he tried to keep the songs about 
        specific experiences (riding bikes, washing dishes, moving somewhere new), and use those specific experiences to elaborate on larger emotional issues and feelings.
        Some songs in particular really nail this idea (Bike Test 1 2 3, Unlimited Breadsticks, Soup and Salad Days, Get Warmer). While this album is a great Rosenstock/BTMI! album
        I still would put it near the bottom as in my opinion, none of the songs really stand out for me when compared to the rest of their discography.
        Though this album does have their most popular and most radio-friendly song "I Don't Love You Anymore". This album is important though as it starts the
        transition of BTMI! from a scrappy, one-man-with-a-laptop band, to a more traditionally produced band with consistent members.

- Scrambles
    - Album Context
        Written because Jeff wanted to record a record that cost $50, Which actually meant that he wanted to make a big record with a big sound.
        They had never spent that much on a record before. Luckily when you have a lot cool friends, you can do this. The record
        was created bit by bit, by different people in many different states, reworked and reworked until the album had the big sound that Jeff was looking
        for. They manage to hit their $50 mark. The album has a grand feel to it and while there is no major theme to it (besides the usual depression and existential dread)
        it really feels like a complete album that flows well with a slow-burning opening song, and a climactic ending song. The album uses similar instrumentation to the last album
        with live drums, guitars, horns, and pianos. In this album though every instrument has it's role in the melody as they move away from the grand messy chaotic sound
        that made up most of their previous albums. The lyrics are the best they've been yet with Jeff practically writing essays on certain subjects,
        experiences, and opinions. This has got to be one of his best albums.

- Adults!!!: Smart!!! Shithammered!!! And Excited By Nothing!!!!!!!
    - Album Context
        Written originally as an EP, I would argue this is more of a mini-album similar to To Leave Or Die In Long Island. Adults was recorded, mixed, and released in 
        5 days with no notice or announcement. There is not much to say about this album. They just kind of threw it out there and moved on. The album is arguably the most
        'fun' BTMI! album, with a ton of horns, claps and rowdy vocal harmonies. If I were going to label any BTMI! album as a party album, it would be this one. The music is catchy
        and upbeat, plus the lyrics aren't too challenging or weird. Quite a few of the songs from this album are on Spotify's top 10 if you look up BTMI!. I don't 
        mean to take away from the songs though. Often the upbeat music distorts the darker lyrics giving them some real depth. Plus All-Ages Show is one of my favorite Jeff Rosenstock
        songs, with one of the best female/male harmonies. But at the end of the day. This feels like a collection of random songs. Which is not a bad thing and shouldn't be discouraged, 
        but it also isn't why I fell in love with BTMI!/Rosenstock.

- Vacation
    - Album Context
        If Get Warmer was the match, Scrambles was the flame, then Vacation is the explosion. This is their magnum opus. Everything they have been building towards culminates perfectly
        in this album. The themes, the lyrics, the songs, all come together to form an album that flows tonally perfect from start to end. With each song contributing so that you must listen to
        the album from start to end to appreciate it's grandeur. The Album was mostly written when Jeff was on a free trip to belize, and it has the sound and feel of a summer-soaked surfer punk album. 
        This album completes the sort of metamorphosis the band has been on from the messy, spastic, all over the place sound, to a carefully-crafted sound with anthemic vocals and grand themes. Many people 
        think this album was too indie and thought it lacked the chaotic sound of past BTMI! records, but I disagree. It still retains the rough, on the verge of a breakdown sound, but it only comes out when
        the song's theme dictates.
