<!-- This program was created by Michael Scott for Assignment 4 for the class CpSc 217
     This program takes the pieces of an image, and randomly scrambles them.
     Then if the "automated" button is pressed, it unscrambles the image.
     
     The image was found on a free public domain site: http://www.publicdomainpictures.net/view-image.php?image=21133
     the Cannon Gifs were created by me out of boredom.
