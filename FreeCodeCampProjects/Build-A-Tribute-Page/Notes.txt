- Album Minus Band
    - Album Context 
        Written after the breakup of Jeff's orginal Ska-Punk band The Arrogant Sons of Bastards. Album Minus Band is an album that just kind of happened.
        After the breakup, Jeff started experimenting with some samples from other bands and just randomly started recording stuff. 
        Not wanting to forget a song lyric, he quickly recorded the song "Sweet Home Cananada" on his mac. This was the start of the band Bomb the Music Industry! 
        This continued with Jeff suddenly having an idea, then recording it with his mac and a $100 microphone. Eventually these tidbits came together to form "Album Minus Band". 
        Jeff was already known for having firm beliefs in the DIY mythos. This ideology would take full form in his new band.
        Bomb the Music Industry! would later become "famous" for being one of the true DIY experiment bands. Only playing <$10 all ages shows, burning their cd's for fans at no cost, 
        spray painting t-shirts, allowing fans who knew the songs to play onstage, and releasing all their music for free long before it became a trend. 
        This album was the start of all that. The album was released for free on QuoteUnquoteRecords.com. The (possibly first?) donation based record label founded by Jeff. 
        The album doesn't seem to have any connective themes, but is rather just a messy, weird, spastic, awesome journey, filled with great unlicensed quotes from tv and movies.
