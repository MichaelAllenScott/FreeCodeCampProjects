# FreeCodeCamp Projects
Some of my cooler projects created for Free Code Camp exercises

### - [Tribute Page](https://michaelallenscott.github.io/Projects/FreeCodeCampProjects/Build-A-Tribute-Page/Rosenstockcom.html)
  - Tribute page built around the discography of Jeff Rosenstock.
  - Jeff Rosenstock's music is very chaotic and spastic, so I wanted this page to have a messy, notebook-scribble feel to it. I spent most of my time, first writing the album descriptions, then Illustrating the images that go along with each album. I'm really happy with the look and I learned a lot about web illustration + using custom images to really make a design pop.

### - [Random Quote Machine](https://michaelallenscott.github.io/Projects/FreeCodeCampProjects/Build-A-Random-Quote-Machine/Vonnequotes.html)
  - Random Quote Machine built for Kurt Vonnegut Quotes only.
  - This is kind of cheating, because I couldn't find an api that would successfully only return Kurt Vonnegut Quotes, without massive string interpolation logic. So I just put them in a string array. Cheap, but I aready know how to do API calls and I really wanted to do Vonnegut quotes only.

### - [Show the Local Weather](https://michaelallenscott.github.io/Projects/FreeCodeCampProjects/Show-The-Local-Weather/show-me-the-weather.html)
  - Weather App that calls out to an API and shows information based on the current location's weather.
