              <strong> Written after the breakup of Jeff's original Ska-Punk band The Arrogant Sons of Bastards. Album Minus Band is
              an album that just kind of happened. After the breakup, Jeff started experimenting with some samples from other
              bands then randomly started recording stuff. Not wanting to forget a song lyric, he quickly recorded the song
              "Sweet Home Cananada" on his mac. This was the start of the band Bomb the Music Industry! This continued with
              Jeff having an idea, then recording it with his mac and a $100 microphone. Eventually these tidbits came together
              to form "Album Minus Band". Jeff was already known for having firm beliefs in the DIY mythos. This ideology
              would take full form in his new band. Bomb the Music Industry! would later become "famous" for being one of
              the true DIY experiment bands. Only playing less than $10 all ages shows, burning their cd 's for fans at no
              cost, spray painting t-shirts, allowing fans who knew the songs to play onstage, and releasing all their music
              for free long before it became a trend. This album was the start of all that. The album doesn't seem to have
              any connective themes, but is rather a messy, weird, spastic, awesome journey, filled with great unlicensed
              quotes from tv and movies.

            <p> This song could arguably be called the mission statement of Bomb The Music Industry! The song talks about the
              fans and corporations that put the scene of the music over the music itself.

              </blockquote>
              Jeff also brings up something in this song that he will have to confront over and over again. The idea of becoming a sellout.
              <blockquote class="blockquote">
                <p class="mb-0"><small>"Sellout, shmellout, it's not about that</small></p>

              This song takes aim at the people who make music for reasons other than the enjoyment of making it.
            </p>
            <li><i>Sweet Home Cananada</i></li>
            <p> Like I mentioned above, this was the song that started the whole band. Jeff didn't want to forget a lyric for
              this song, so he went home, recorded it and ended up making a whole album after this song.
            </p>
            <li><i>FRRRREEEEEE BIIIIIIRRRRRD! FRRRREEEEEE BIIIIIIRD!!!!</i></li>
            <p> Actually written by Laura Stevenson, who would become a main member of Bomb The Music Industry for quite a bit.
              She would then later go on to make her own solo stuff. This song talks about the feeling of singing music for
              jerks in bars, biting your tongue, then taking the money and leaving.
            </p>
            <li><i>Future 86</i></li>
            <p> The vocals for this song were recorded after an ASOB show. They handed out a bunch of lyric sheets and had about
              80 or 90 kids screaming and clapping the lyrics. It gives this song that loose, group of rowdy friends singing
              together feel.

              <strong> Written almost immediately after Jeff finished Album Minus Band, "To Leave or Die In Long Island" is a product
              of being stuck with your parents in your twenties, working for minimum wage, and feeling like you don't relate
              to what is happening around you. This didn't start as an album, but rather an EP. It ended up somewhere inbetween,
              so it's on the shorter side with only 8 tracks. Most of the songs are about Jeff's frustration with the daily
              grind and the idea of what growing up and success really mean. In general just working a crap job in a crap
              town and feeling like there is no point to it all. This is all summed up perfectly by the last song on the
              album "SYKE! LIFE IS AWESOME!" in which Jeff admits that even though he feels he's mostly wasting his time,
              every once in a while life gives you something truly nice, which sort of makes it all worth it. The last song
              brings the themes of sadness and existential depression together and leave the album on a bittersweet note.
              The feel of the album is similar to Album Minus Band, but a little bit more polished, and a little less spastic,
              with each song feeling like a complete song, rather that short spurts that make a whole. The album keeps the
              same sound with synthesizers, saxophones, and drum machines played stupid fast.

            <li><i>Syke! Life Is Awesome!</i></li>
            <p> As I mentioned above, I love this song, and think it is possibly Jeff's best song. The song could be used to
              sum up Jeff's whole life philosophy which is that life is mostly frustration and disappointment but every once
              in a while a moment comes along and you recognize that life isn't all bad. That there are quite a few things
              in your life that you wouldn't trade for anything. That a lot of the bad things in your life, led to the good
              things. The song incorporates multiple different genres and rushes from one to the next feeling like a mad
              house theme song. The crazy frenetic music, combined with the lyrics, make this a perfect ending song for the
              album. If anyone asked me why I love Jeff's music, I'd point to this song.

              <strong> Written after Jeff moved out of his parents and into a nice apartment in an upper middle-class neighborhood in
              Queens, NY. With Jeff once again feeling isolated. Though for a different reason. Caused by living in an area
              of a demographic not your own, a lack of nearby friends, and no money to visit those friends. The album was
              almost completely recorded in Jeff's Apartment which, due to the area, meant he could only record between 5:30
              and 6:30 PM. Just like AMB and TLODILI, this album was also solely recorded on Jeff's Laptop with a cheap microphone.
              This album uses the same style of instruments as the first two, with the frenetic fake drums, synthesizers,
              piano, and guitars. On this album though, you can hear Jeff start to experiment with the genres, not just making
              messy punk rock, but injecting some pop and melody into his songs (Side Projects are Never Successful, Sorry
              Brooklyn Dancing Won't Solve Anything, Anywhere I Lay My Head). The resulting sound is probably his weirdest
              album of all, with his trademark chaotic sound mixed with more traditional pop piano, horns, and synthesizers,
              creating a sort of mad-scientist, twisted fun-house album. The lyrical content is similar to the last album,
              with most of the songs being about isolation, depression, disappointment with the human race, and frustration
              with the music business. This is also the first album that was released for free on QuoteUnquoteRecords.com.
              The (possibly first?) donation based record label founded by Jeff. I consider this to be the most eccentric,
              bizarre album Jeff has produced, so if that is your thing, I'd give this one a listen.

            <p> One of Jeff's most cynical songs about corporations, all camoflauged with a poppy, cheesy, piano rhythym. Jeff
              sings about the clausterphobia he feels in the modern world where the only shade in cities are billboards.
              How the roads are covered with fast-food litter. How even revolutionary bands like fugazi sold their albums.
              Jeff attacks all these different entities, but then admits that as much as he rants, he is no different from
              them.

            <li><i>5 Funerals</i></li>
            <p> One of Jeff's most depressing songs. A song that was created because 5 of Jeff's friends + family died around
              the same period. Jeff felt terrible not only about their deaths but about the way he views death. So Jeff wrote
              this song apologizing for his selfishness. This is possibly one of his most nihlistic songs. The music contrasts
              the depressing lyrics by being largely upbeat and fast-paced.
            </p>
            <li><i>Anywhere I Lay My Head</i></li>
            <p> Actually a cover of Tom Waits song of the same name. I just feel this song needs noted for it's bizarre almost
              baseball park like theme music at the end. The original song already had a weird trumpet part at the end that
              worked to contrast the depressing lyrics, but Jeff's version makes it even stranger by adding a cheering crowd
              and upbeat synth. This works as a great weird end to this bizarre album.

            <p>
              <strong> Written during a 6 month period in Athens, Georgia. Get Warmer is the first BTMI! album that marks a transition
              into a more professional recording process. Recorded with real people, using real instruments, in a real recording
              studio. Almost all the instruments were recorded live by a large group of different people. The band was still
              considered a "collective" at this point and had not boiled down to the five band members it would later become.
              The album still has the traditional BTMI! sound that the previous 3 albums had, but the real instruments give
              it a fuller, less synthetic feel. The new production also makes the songs a bit cleaner, well formed, and more
              deliberate in their sound. It's also the first BTMI! album that has a specific theme behind it. The songs all
              take place in a single story arc in one location. Jeff says he tried to keep the songs about specific experiences
              (riding bikes, washing dishes, moving somewhere new), and using those specific experiences to elaborate on
              larger emotional issues and feelings. Some songs in particular nail this idea (Bike Test 1 2 3, Unlimited Breadsticks,
              Soup and Salad Days, Get Warmer). While this album is a great Rosenstock/BTMI! album I still would put it near
              the bottom as in my opinion, none of the songs really stand out for me when compared to the rest of their discography.
              Although this album does have their most popular and most radio-friendly song "I Don't Love You Anymore". This
              album is important as it starts the transition of BTMI! from a scrappy, one-man-with-a-laptop band, to a more
              traditionally produced band with consistent members, real instruments, and a grander, more anthemic sound.

            <p> In this song Jeff uses the theme of riding a bike to convey the struggles and joys of life. The struggles uphill
              and joy of speeding downhill.

            </p>
            <li><i>Depression is NO FUN.</i></li>
            <p> Quite a few of the songs on this album are about moving and the idea that everywhere you move to is essentialy
              the same. If you are expecting a move to fix the personal problems in your life, it likely won't work out.
              The problems are going to be there no matter where you go, until you face them. I think this song expresses
              this feeling best, and one of the best lyrics about this idea is:
              <blockquote class="blockquote">
                <p class="mb-0"><small>"Even when locations change</small></p>
                <p class="mb-0"><small>the imbalance stays the same</small></p>

              <strong> Written because Jeff wanted to record a record that cost $50, Which actually meant that he wanted to make a big
              record with a big sound. They had never spent that much on a record before. Luckily when you have a lot cool
              friends, you can do this. The record was created bit by bit, by different people in many different states,
              reworked and reworked until the album had the big sound that Jeff was looking for. They manage to hit their
              $50 mark. The album has a grand feel to it and while there is no major theme to it (besides the usual depression
              and existential dread) it feels like a complete album that flows well with a slow-burning opening song, and
              a climactic ending song. The album uses similar instrumentation to the last album with live drums, guitars,
              horns, and pianos. In this album though every instrument has it's role in the melody as they move away from
              the messy chaotic sound that made up most of their previous albums. The lyrics are the best they've been yet
              with Jeff practically writing essays on certain subjects, experiences, and opinions. This has got to be one
              of his best albums. Not necessarily because it has any unique gimmick or idea driving it, every song is just
              really really good.

            <p> Jeff claims he wrote this song because He wanted it to be in Guitar Hero or Rock Band. All of the swearing probably
              prevented that though. This is a really fun song that has a great fun feel to it. The lyrics are about ignoring
              what everyone else says is fun, and doing what you enjoy doing. Sailing your own boat. This is a great intro
              song to anyone new to the band or Jeff.

            <li><i>(Shut) Up the Punx!!!</i></li>
            <p> Lyrically this is one of my favorite songs. The song is about how the punk movement was originally about liking
              what you liked, allowing others to like what they like, and not letting anyone else define who you are. But
              the punk movement has become fashionable and cliquish.

              Jeff is saying that punk has become another brand, and is not about the music or the ideology anymore. If you're not this
              or that you are not a true "punk".

              I don't want to just post all the lyrics to this song, but I think this song is not only relevant in punk culture, but any
              subculture that is exclusive. Too many subcultures are founded as a haven for people with weird interests and
              they end up becoming exclusionary and saying if you don't x you're not y. This could all be summed up in the
              lyric
              <blockquote class="blockquote">

              <strong> Written originally as an EP, I would argue this is more of a mini-album similar to To Leave Or Die In Long Island.
              Adults was recorded, mixed, and released in 5 days with no notice or announcement. There is not much to say
              about this album. They just kind of threw it out there and moved on. The album is arguably the most 'fun' BTMI!
              album, with a ton of horns, claps and rowdy vocal harmonies. If I were going to label any BTMI! album as a
              party album, it would be this one. The music is catchy and upbeat, plus the lyrics aren't too challenging or
              weird. Quite a few of the songs from this album are on Spotify's top 10 if you look up BTMI!. I don't mean
              to take away from the songs though. Often the upbeat music distorts the darker lyrics giving them some real
              depth. Plus All-Ages Show is one of my favorite Jeff Rosenstock songs, with one of the best female/male harmonies.
              But at the end of the day. This feels like a collection of random songs. Which is not a bad thing and shouldn't
              be discouraged, but it also isn't why I fell in love with BTMI!/Rosenstock.

              (Laura Stevenson) doesn't come in until halfway through the song. The song builds and builds until it both

            <p>
              <strong> If Get Warmer was the match, Scrambles was the flame, then Vacation is the explosion. This is their magnum opus.
              Everything they have been building towards culminates perfectly in this album. The themes, the lyrics, the
              songs, all come together to form an album that flows tonally perfect from start to finish. With each song contributing
              so that you must listen to the album from start to end to appreciate it's grandeur. The Album was mostly written
              when Jeff was on a free trip to belize, and it has the sound and feel of a summer-soaked surfer punk album.
              Where most of BTMI's past work is upbeat with negative lyrics, Vacation is sort of the opposite. The music
              is still fun, but there is a thread of melancholy through it all. This matches up with the lyrics, which see
              Jeff trying to be positive and happy, but still experiencing the typical fears and worrys even while he is
              on vacation. The album rides this balance of hopeful sadness. This gives the album a very unique sound, like
              if Weezer and the Beach Boys got together and just got real sad/emotional and made a record. This album sounds
              big though, and it truly feels like you're experiencing the wave of relatable emotions that Jeff was on when
              he wrote this album. With the slow burn opening, expressing a desire to get away, the fun and excitement experienced
              upon first arrival, the crash and resumation of old feelings and fears, the acceptance and appreciation of
              what you have, and the climactic ending. I could be making all that up, but the point is that this album has
              a FEEL to it. You can feel the plot of the album with it's highs and lows. Once again you must listen to it
              from beginning to end to truly appreciate it. This album completes the metamorphosis the band has been on from
              the messy, spastic, all over the place sound, to a carefully-crafted sound with anthemic vocals and grand themes.
              Many people think this album was too indie and thought it lacked the chaotic sound of past BTMI! records, but
              I disagree. It still retains the rough, on the verge of a breakdown sound, but it only comes out when the song's
              theme dictates. This album will end up being the swan song for Bomb the Music Industry. Having accomplished
              what they set out to accomplish. At this point in the band's mythos, the band had become a consistent group
              of 5-ish members, touring the country in their spare time, making some pocket money, and releasing the music
              they made for free. Jeff created the band as an attempt to 100% pursue the idea of a DIY band that never compromised
              their values, and they succeeded at that. The band members were going through some different personal stuff
              at the time, and so instead of going on hiatus, they decided to finalize it and call it quits. Thus Vacation
              becomes the perfect finale to the band's musical trajectory and evolution. BTMI would play their last show
              at the Warsaw in NYC to an uproarious and loving crowd. A fan-made documentary would be made about BTMI call
              Never Get Tired. You should give it a watch.

            <li><i>The Shit That You Hate</i></li>
            <p> A 6-minute song about how the world doesn't care about your problems. Jeff starts the song singing of some mistake
              he made, and how it didn't seem like a big deal at the time. After all there are much bigger issues in the
              world. Why is he being hounded for such a small issue. He goes on to sing about how you can't run away from
              your problems or expect pity. "And nobody cares. We all got sorrows So hold onto your home and onto your hope
              Sorrow don't answer problems" The song builds and builds repeating the same lyric over and over again "The
              shit that you hate don't make you special" The lyrical content is pretty minimal for a 6-minute song, but the
              way the song builds and amplifies is pretty special. It's hard not to scream the lyrics at the end along with
              Jeff
            </p>
            <li><i>Hurricane Waves</i></li>
            <p> This song manages to perfect that summer-punk sound. Yet the lyrics are, as usual, about something darker. The
              result of constant procrastination. Putting off the boring things to do the fun things, again and again, until
              even the fun things have lost their luster. You are left wondering why you don't do anything anymore. There's
              not much more to the song than this, but I think if I was to pick one song that represents this album, it would
              be this one.
            </p>
            <li><i>Campaign for a Better Next Weekend</i></li>
            <p> This is a great opening song, but I put it here because the video of BTMI playing this song at Warsaw in Never
              Get Tired demands a watch. It will show you how much love there is for this band out there. How many people
              this band affected and how emotional their finale was, not only to the fans, but especially to the band members.

              <strong> Written after BTMI! was disbanded, I Look Like Shit unceremoniously became Jeff's solo debut. Jeff describes
              the reasoning for this album best: "A handful of them were demos for a Bomb the Music Industry! EP called I
              Always Dread The End Of Summer, but shit got busy and that didn't end up happening. And then a bunch of them
              was for a slower record I was working on called I'm Serious, I'm Sorry, but it wasn't really coming together
              terribly fast and who the hell knows if that'll ever happen. However, I do know that if leave a bunch of food
              on your kitchen counter for too long, that shit is gonna get moldy, start attracting flies and smell like shit.
              So instead of having these jams just sit around doing nothing, here they all are along with some more new songs
              and some covers in full noisy drum machine shitty vocals glory." I Look Like Shit helped set Jeff's solo stuff
              apart from his former ASOB and BTMI! work as most of these songs don't really sound like either of those. It's
              a very personal album, with less punk, more piano, and lyrics that sound like they were ripped straight from
              a diary. These songs are depressing, like nihlistic, there is no point to anything why bother, depressing.
              Jeff considered not even releasing them because he thought they might be too much. He eventually released them
              because his friends reminded him that: "it's okay to release songs with lyrics that I may think are too dark
              and reminding me that those are actually the only lyrics I ever want to listen to" The album serves as a great
              start to Jeff's solo career, distinguishing his newer style from his older style, allowing him to make whatever
              music he wants without being beholden to a genre.

            <li><i>Twinkle</i></li>
            <p> This song starts off with a great piano riff that turns into a bizarro ben folds song. Like something early goofy
              Ben Folds Five would have made. Except the song lyrics are very depressing. They are about the paranoia Jeff
              experiences after knowing that a friend of his got killed in her home during a robbery. The song is about the
              constant fear Jeff experiences in his own home. The fear of living in a world where such a terrible thing could
              have happened. Per typical Jeff style the depressing lyrics are overshadowed by the fast paced, fun piano and
              guitars. He even throws in an 8-bit breakdown near the end.
            </p>
            <li><i>Bonus Oceans</i></li>
            <p> I don't have much to say about this song, other than it's my favorite on the album. It's more of an indie song
              than it is a punk song. The lyrics are solid. The song builds up really well and explodes during the emotional
              climax of the song. It's also my favorite song I've heard them play live. You can't help but feel emotional
              as Jeff belts out the last two verses to this song.
            </p>
            <li><i>Amen</i></li>
            <p> This is a pretty unique song coming from Jeff when compared to the rest of his discography. This is a slow-tempo
              6-minute song that deals heavily with religion. This is another one of Jeff's extremely depressing songs. Possible
              top 3 in my opinion. It's a very impressive song, but definitely not for everyone.
            </p>
            <li><i>I Don't Wanna Die</i></li>
            <p> This is just a really really fun song. The song was originally by the Ging Nang Boyz, and Jeff doesn't do to
              much to make it different from their version. The song is just 4 minutes of Jeff singing Japanese except the
              chorus during which he screams "I don't wanna die!" It's a very silly song and a great song to end this largely
              depressing album on.

              <strong>Written 2-ish years after I Look Like Shit was released, We Cool? is Jeff's official intended debut solo album.
              It is also Jeff's first record with the record company SideOneDummy. SideOneDummy acts more like a traditional
              record company, compared to the DIY/donation based labels his music had been released on in the past. SideOneDummy
              was cool enough to allow this album to continue being released for free on QuoteUnquoteRecords while SideOneDummy
              was selling it on their website. So anyone could still download the album for free, but they could also now
              purchase a physical copy or buy a tshirt. When Jeff was running BTMI! many fans complained about the lack of
              merchandise as they wanted to support the band, but felt they had no way to do so. Jeff has since moved on
              from the extreme DIY views and now allows himself to make some steady money from his music and merchandise.
              Something he had not been able to do for quite a while. Some may view this as selling out, but I think that's
              absurd. Jeff has spent most of his life making music, pleasing fans, and rejecting money. He deserves to live
              a comfortable life at some point. Anyway, We Cool? if a phenominal album. The goal as described by Jeff was
              to make: "pop songs that got real weird and gross". I think this is the perfect way to describe this album.
              This album picks up and improves where I Look Like Shit left off. The songs on this album are messy, melancholic,
              self-reflective pieces of pop punk. The lyrics are the best he's written yet with songs like Nausea, I'm Serious
              I'm Sorry, Polar Bear or Africa, and Get Old Forever, all about Jeff confronting who he is, what he wants,
              and how he treats others. These are the most relatable songs he's written yet. Not even considering that these
              songs fun as hell, with catchy melodies, anthemic choruses, and solo's that will make your adrenaline rush.
              The album was also the first of Jeff's to get any recognition by charting on a couple different billboards.
              An experience that was new to Jeff. Despite being a prominent figure in the DIY/Underground scene, Jeff hadn't
              (and arguably still hasn't) reached much fame in the mainstream crowd. So charting was a unique experience.
              This is one of his most fun records, and with the more straightforward punk sound, I'd say this is probably
              the best starting point if you're new to his music.

            <li><i>You, in Weird Cities</i></li>
            <p> One of Jeff's best songs and probably the best starter Jeff Rosenstock song. Just a solid punk song that is bursting
              with energy and emotion. The ultimate crowd song. Everytime I've seen Jeff live, people absolutely lose their
              minds during this song.
            </p>
            <li><i>Nausea</i></li>
            <p> Another Bizarro Ben Folds song. I can't even accurately categorize this song as it's so bizarre. This is another
              one of Jeff's weird twisted carnival songs, with the upbeat piano, handclaps, and sing-along vocals, all being
              played over lyrics about depression, isolation, and turning away from those close to you. I think this may
              be his most popular song. Rightly so. It's hard to find music that has this unique a sound.
            </p>
            <li><i>I'm Serious, I'm Sorry</i></li>
            <p> In the top 3 of Jeff's depressing songs. This is a song about a friend killing himself and Jeff regretting not
              noticing the signs sooner. This is one of the best songs I've ever heard on the subject. Jeff talks about how
              he and this person were never very close, and Jeff could have helped him out, talked to him, befriended him,
              shared experiences with him, but Jeff was to busy focusing on his own problems. Jeff wants to tell this person
              that he knows what he's going through, that he experiences the same feelings. But it's too late and Jeff can
              never get that opportunity back. Possible the best lyrics jeff has written. I can't help but feel emotional
              every time I listen to this song. The way the song slows down to a single guitar strum, than bursts with emotion
              when the chorus comes in, gives me chills every time. I can think of few songs where the sound and structure
              of the song match the emotion more perfectly than this one.

            <p>
              <strong> Written right around the time Jeff married his long time girlfriend, WORRY was originally supposed to be an album
              about love. It turned into something much bigger. Interspersed between the songs of love and growing old together,
              Jeff tackles a grand scope of issues that have been escalating in modern times. Corporate impersonations in
              the music industry, police brutality, the numbing effects of technology, and the selfishness of those in power.
              The combination of these themes somehow perfectly create an album about the absurdity of modern life, and the
              feeling of growing together with someone in the middle of such absurdity. The feeling of walking down a crowded
              street with clausterphobic thoughts about how everything is beyond hope, but then meeting someone and experiencing
              that flutter, that rush of excitement, but also the fear that this too will soon be beyond repair. Those hopes
              and fears are what this album is about. The album begins slowly with each song being seperate and isolated.
              But as the album goes on, the songs grow and grow and eventually the second half of the album explodes and
              each song flows breathlessly into the next, the pace never letting up until Jeff is screaming at the end of
              the album repeating the same line over and over while the band's instruments wail. You can't help but feel
              exhausted after the album. WORRY has been on numerous top x lists for Album of the Year, and was even ranked
              #1 on USA Today. A pretty huge feat for an artist that charted for the first time the previous year. It seems
              the world is finally taking stock of Rosenstock. The album is considered by many to be the best he's ever made.
              The term "magnum opus" comes up a lot if you look at the reviews for this album. But it absolutely deserves
              this title. This album is incredible. How he manages to combine so many different musical styles and yet have
              them all fit tonally is beyond me. As per typical Rosenstock fasion, Jeff humbly accepted the praise, and moved
              on towards his next project. Still playing free shows, still giving all his music away for free, still making
              the music he wants to make the way he wants to make it. Jeff has never listened to anyone who told him it shouldn't
              be done this way, and with the success of WORRY, I don't think he's going to start anytime soon.

          <ul>
            <li><i>Wave Goodnight to Me</i></li>
            <p> Jeff wrote this song about the closing of the DIY studio Death By Audio, which was closed and turned into a VICE
              office. The song is loosely about how all these DIY spaces are closing and dying, making room for corporations
              that only pretend to care about whatever they're selling. The lyrics are ambiguous enough though you could
              interpret them a couple different ways. This is probably the best "single" song on this album. An album that
              rewards one-time ordinal listening. Solid fun song. Great for first time Rosenstock listeners.
            </p>
            <li><i>I Did Something Weird Last Night</i></li>
            <p> Jeff wrote this song as a flashback to the time where him and his wife first met. The lyrics represent that butterfly
              feeling of meeting someone new and experiencing the euphoric hope and frightening worry that accompany such
              an encounter.

              </blockquote>
              I think this song is more like what Jeff imagined this whole album would be originally. A story about relationships that
              everyone can relate to. The album didn't turn out this way, and I think it's for the better as what it became
              is amazing. But The sound and lyrics of this song are so fun, I wouldn't have complained.
            </p>
            <li><i>Blast Damage Days</i></li>
            <p> Lyrically this is not only my favorite on the album, but essentially summarizes the theme of the whole album.
              Jeff sings of all the trouble that these systems in the world have caused, the selfishness, the disconnect,
              the pride. Even though the world seems to be falling apart around him, Jeff is never letting go of the one
              he loves. She is all that matters to him in this world. Musically the song serves more as an interlude between
              explosive tracks, but lyrically I think it's the best on the album.

            <li><i>...While You're Alive</i></li>
            <p> Another song that summarizes not only the themes of the album, but the album title itself. On this track Jeff
              sings to his loved one, trying to tell her all the things he wishes to express before she dies. He mentions
              that when you die, people always say nice things about you, so it doesn't mean anything. Jeff wants her to
              know exactly how he feels while she's alive.
              <blockquote class="blockquote">
                <p class="mb-0"><small>"When love is dead</small></p>
                <p class="mb-0"><small>We'll remember gentle nudges keeping us in bed</small></p>
                <p class="mb-0"><small>Or laughing at funerals, queasy at carnivals</small></p>
                <p class="mb-0"><small>Listening to heartbeats slowing down as we keep growing old"</small></p>
              </blockquote>
              Jeff then mentions one of the core themes of the album which is that love is terrifying and beautiful. It's not always a
              warm, euphoric embrace. It can be an anxiety ridden nightmare caring for someone so deeply.
